# Simple Godot Gaussian Splatting

Early work in progress of making gaussian splats play nicely in Godot.

Many ideas and much of the code adapted from:

* [haztro - godot-gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/haztro/godot-gaussian-splatting)
* [Warren Jennings - Godot Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/LightningStorm0/Godot-Gaussian-Splatting)

Ply-file was created by me using [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat).
